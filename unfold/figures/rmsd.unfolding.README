Plot of the RMSD from the starting conformation (the native state) for
the 35 alpha carbons, over the first ~35 nanoseconds of an unfolding
trajectory at 500 K. Langevin dynamics. NPT (monte carlo barostat).
The native state was solvated in a ~54A box with TIP3P water an NaCL to
40 mM. The simulation was run with OpenMM 5.1 on a NVidia GTX 660 GPU. 

The inset figure is an example unfolded structure, at 14ns elapsed simulation
time.
